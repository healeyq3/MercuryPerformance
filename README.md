# MercuryPerformance
Cloned Repository from the MercuryXC organization I created to work on a project for my high school's running program. 
The code in the repository was written by myself, John O'Brien, and Aidan Gannon. Ben Tolliday helped with the overall design. 
The three of them decided to stop working on the project at the end of June, and I kept working on it through August. 
Please note that at the beginning of July I also began pushing code under a new account so the insights do not properly reflect the entirety of the project. 
The product is unfinished, but the backend is fully functional and it was just the frontend that needed to be fully implemented in order for the product to be deployed.
